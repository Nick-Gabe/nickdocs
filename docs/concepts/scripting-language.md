title: Scripting Language
---

At the start, scripting languages and programming languages may seem exactly the same, and in fact scripting languages ARE programming languages, but this differentiation appears because they have some differences!

## Scripting Languages aren't compiled

Yes, they aren't. Instead they are **interpreted**! And what is interpreting a language? - you may ask.
Scripting languages are interpreted in runtime, this means it will read line by line of your code and "translate" it in real time, rather than programming languages which need to compiled before executing.

## Interpreters

When you're in C making some program, you're creating something from scratch. But take JavaScript or any web technology as an example, they do not create things from scratch, they are created on top of another program that will interpret it, on this case the browser, that reads the code and show us the result of it.
